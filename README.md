# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis (2010 – 2014)

When I explored the company’s sales data, my main goal was to understand how total revenue changed over time — to identify which years drove the most growth and when performance started to decline.

## 🎯 Objective  
To analyze the **year-wise sales performance** between **2010 and 2014**, track growth trends, and uncover meaningful insights about business performance and market stability.

---

## 🔍 Approach  
I analyzed several years of sales transactions, focusing on three key metrics — total revenue, total quantity sold, and number of unique customers.  
The data was cleaned, structured, and optimized to ensure accuracy. Once ready, I compared each year’s total sales to highlight growth patterns and shifts in performance.

## 📈 Insights & Findings  

Here’s what the analysis revealed:  

- **2010 → ₹43,419** – Very low sales activity, likely the initial phase of business operations.  
- **2011 → ₹7,075,088** – A major rise in sales, marking the first strong growth year.  
- **2012 → ₹5,842,231** – A slight dip but still a healthy and consistent year.  
- **2013 → ₹16,344,878** – The breakthrough year, contributing over **55%** of total revenue.  
- **2014 → ₹45,642** – A sharp decline, possibly due to reduced activity or incomplete data.

**💰 Total Revenue (2010–2014): ₹29,356,250**

## 📊 Trend Summary  
The company experienced a significant upward trend between **2011 and 2013**, followed by a sudden drop in 2014.  
This pattern could indicate either a business contraction, market shift, or data cutoff for that year.  

The standout observation was **2013**, where sales growth far exceeded all previous years — suggesting either an expansion phase, new product success, or an effective sales strategy.

## 🚀 Conclusion  
Through this time-based analysis, I was able to turn raw transactional data into a meaningful story of the company’s journey — from slow beginnings to remarkable growth, and finally a decline that warrants deeper investigation.  

This analysis helps businesses:  
- Identify growth and slowdown periods 📈
